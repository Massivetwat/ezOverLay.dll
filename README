TO use ezOverLay.dll compile this poject and there will be a dll located in the bin folder. 
Reference it in your own project and add these things.

At the very start add this 



Now add this in your load method

CheckForIllegalThreadCalls = false;

If you don't understand this then watch my next video that explains how to use this dll ;)
