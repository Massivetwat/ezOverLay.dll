This is my first ever dll, I made all of this in about 5 hours. There will be things that might not work.

TO use EzOverlay.dll compile this poject and there will be a dll located in the bin folder. 
Reference it in your own project and add these things.

If you don't understand this then watch my next video that explains how to use this dll ;)
